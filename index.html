  <h1>Why do we need Women in Tech ?</h1>
  <p>Increasing representation of women in tech is important not only for the brilliant career opportunities it can offer to them, but also for the ability of the technology industry as a whole to innovate and rise to meet the needs of society</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="course-col">
      <h3>Diversity Generates More Revenue</h3>
      <p>Compared to their peers, high-gender-diversity companies deliver slightly better returns, and they have outperformed, on average, less diverse companies over the past five years. Companies that not only hire but also manage to retain more women put themselves in a position to automatically gain a competitive advantage, a benefit that extends to all stakeholders.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="course-col">
      <h3>Diversity of thought leads to better problem-solving</h3>
      <p>Collaborating with individuals of different genders, sexual orientations, ethnicities, and race leads to increased innovation and enhanced problem-solving. Hiring for diversity means onboarding different methods and strategies of thinking, as well as the increased capability to understand the pain points of all members of your target demographic. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="course-col">
      <h3>Increase female role models</h3>
      <p>By celebrating female tech leaders, it will hopefully encourage more girls to pursue their interests and careers in tech, thus increasing the hiring pool diversity. We need to ensure young girls have strong role models of other successful women in STEM and that women have a seat at the table so they can engage men on the topic of gender equality.</p>
